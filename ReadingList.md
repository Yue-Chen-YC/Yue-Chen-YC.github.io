## Books I Keep Coming Back To
Here’s a list of books that never seem to leave my mind (or my nightstand). I re-read them in both Mandarin and English—these are the ones I revisit, quote endlessly, and always find something new in.

1. **To the Lighthouse** — *Virginia Woolf*  

2. **The Waves** — *Virginia Woolf*  

3. **Lolita** — *Vladimir Nabokov*  

4. **Fang Si-Chi's First Love Paradise: A Novel** — *Lin Yi-han*

## Current Reading List
Here’s where things get messy. These are books I’m reading, want to read, or just like having on my shelf.

- **Pale Fire** — *Vladimir Nabokov*  
- **Madness and Civilization** — *Michel Foucault*

## Favorite Lines
Sometimes a single line can say it all.

<div id="random-line" style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;"></div>
<div id="line-author" style="margin-top: 5px; color: gray;"></div>

<script>
  // Array of your favorite lines and their authors
  const favoriteLines = [
    { text: "We read to know we are not alone.", author: "C.S. Lewis" },
    { text: "The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.", author: "Ernest Hemingway" },
    { text: "I am a part of all that I have met.", author: "Tennyson" },
    { text: "Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final.", author: "Rainer Maria Rilke" },
    { text: "And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.", author: "Anaïs Nin" },
    { text: "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.", author: "Carl Sagan" },
    { text: "I contain multitudes.", author: "Walt Whitman" },
    // Add your own poems or lines here
  ];

  // Select a random line
  const randomLine = favoriteLines[Math.floor(Math.random() * favoriteLines.length)];

  // Display the line and author in the HTML
  document.getElementById("random-line").innerText = `"${randomLine.text}"`;
  document.getElementById("line-author").innerText = `— ${randomLine.author}`;
</script>
