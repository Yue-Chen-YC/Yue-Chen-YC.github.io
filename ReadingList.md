## Books I Keep Coming Back To
Here’s a list of books that never seem to leave my mind (or my nightstand). I re-read them in both Mandarin and English—these are the ones I revisit, quote endlessly, and always find something new in.

1. **To the Lighthouse** — *Virginia Woolf*  

2. **The Waves** — *Virginia Woolf*  

3. **Lolita** — *Vladimir Nabokov*  

4. **Fang Si-Chi's First Love Paradise: A Novel** — *Lin Yi-han*

## Favorite Lines
Sometimes a single line can say it all, so read between the lines.
