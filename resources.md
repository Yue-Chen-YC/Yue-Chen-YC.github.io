## Vocabulary Assessment – PPVT

### What is the PPVT?

The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) is a standardized test of **receptive vocabulary**. On each trial, the examiner says a word, and the participant selects one picture out of four that best matches the meaning of that word. Because the response only requires pointing (rather than speaking or reading), the PPVT is widely used with children, multilingual speakers, heritage speakers, and populations where productive language may be limited.

Scores are norm-referenced by age and can be used to estimate vocabulary level, compare groups, or include receptive vocabulary as a covariate in experimental work.
