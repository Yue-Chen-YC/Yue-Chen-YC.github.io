## Vocabulary Assessment – PPVT

### What is the PPVT?

The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) is a standardized test of **receptive vocabulary**. On each trial, the examiner says a word, and the participant selects one picture out of four that best matches the meaning of that word. Because the response only requires pointing (rather than speaking or reading), the PPVT is widely used with children, multilingual speakers, heritage speakers, and populations where productive language may be limited.

Scores are norm-referenced by age and can be used to estimate vocabulary level, compare groups, or include receptive vocabulary as a covariate in experimental work.

## Transcription & Corpus Analysis – CLAN

### What is CLAN?

**CLAN** (Computerized Language ANalysis) is the main software used with the **CHAT** transcription format and the TalkBank/CHILDES corpora. It supports:

- Creating and editing CHAT-formatted transcripts  
- Running automatic morphological analysis via **MOR**  or **batchalign2**
- Computing frequencies, MLU, TTR, Word Type, Word Tokens, and many other measures from transcripts  
- Working with multiple languages (e.g., `eng`, `zho`, `yue`, etc.)

It’s widely used in child language, clinical, and corpus-based research, and is basically the standard toolchain if you work with TalkBank data.

This PDF walks through installing CLAN on macOS, installing MOR grammars, finding CLAN on your laptop, setting up new scripts, using header and ID tiers, language codes, common shortcuts, and conventions for gestures, code-switching, and other CHAT symbols.
